## Simple Charity Tech Stack Documentation

Welcome! Whether [you're new](/matthewletter.md) to web development with Simple Charity or you're a seasoned developer and are just looking to debug something, you'll find everything you need here. 

### Resources for Learning

Simple Charity's website is built on a few key technologies. Some are important to learn before you start working on the site, and others are best learned while working on it: 

##### Preliminaries: 

1. The Command Line (Powershell on Windows and Bash/ZSh on Mac)
2. Understand Git
3. Get to know the file system on your maachine

##### Before you start, you'll probably want to learn about: 

1. Git
2. HTML/CSS
3. Craft Basics 
4. Tailwind
5. Basic Vue

##### Once you get going, take a look at: 

1. Craft Commerce
2. Advanced Vue
3. Typeform
4. ActiveCampaign

### Dependencies

1. VSCode. Or if you _really_ like another code editor, you can use that - but VS Code has some very useful plugins that will make your life _much_ easier: 
    - PostCSS Language Support & HTML CSS Support  
    - Live Server  
    - JSON  
    - Headwind  
    - Twig & Twig Language 
    - Vue  
    - Javascript Code Snippets  
2. Git, if it's not already installed on your machine. 
3. Tower. SC uses a git methodology called _Git Flow_, and tower makes Git Flow very intuitive. They offer free licenses for students at accredited universities. If you're very confortable with git in the command line, this isn't strictly necessary. 
4. NPM and NodeJS
5. Docker Desktop
6. OpenSSH
7. PHP
8. Composer
9. [Windows Only] Windows-NVM
10. [Windows Only] WSL 2  

### Quick Start Guide

1. Open up your terminal and create a new directory 
`mkdir simplecharity/dev`
2. CD into your working directory
`cd simplecharity/dev`
3. Clone the git repository into your simplecharity/dev folder, then check out the correct git branch
`git clone git@github.com:jonathanmelville/simplecharity.git .`

4. Launch Docker Desktop, then ensure that the environment (dev) exists
5. Run `docker-compose up`
