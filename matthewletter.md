Hi,

I am Mathew Luo, one of Simple Charity's 2021 summer interns. This is the first year that Brian recruited interns to work on web development. I spent my seven weeks at the internship learning the techstack and designing and coding pages for the website. I will outline the different web technologies I used, my experience working on the website, and the lessons I learned from the internship. 

The website itself is entirely custom, and its construction was outsourced to Jonathan Melville, a contractor Brian hired. As of the time this is written, Simple Charity does not have an engineer on the team. The front-end of the website is built on Tailwind CSS and VueJS, and the backend is built on Twig and PHP. Fields are entered through Craft CMS. The local development environment runs on Docker. 

I spent over half of the summer learning the tech stack from scratch (starting from basically no knowledge of either CSS or Javascript), and at the end of the summer I was able to mock up new web pages which I passed to my coworker Andrew Forrester to integrate into the live website. I think that at least basic knowledge of general programming, Git, the command line, and HTML+CSS+Javascript are required in order to make meaningful contributions to the website. Most of the actual code is written in Tailwind, and you will need knowledge of VueJS and CraftCMS to write responsive code and integrate it into the website. 

Before starting the internship, I would recommend you download all of the required software packages and, if you are able to set up the environment, poke around the file tree to see where stuff is. There is quite a bit of custom CSS and custom JS written (outside of Vue and Tailwind) that makes life a lot harder. Setting up the environment itself took Andrew and I four calls spread over two weeks, and having that development environment from the get go would already be a huge help. 

In terms of resources for learning web development, I would recommend Adam Wathan's "Designing with Tailwind CSS" series on Youtube and Colt Steele's "Web Developer Bootcamp" on UDemy. There are also good resources online for learning CraftCMS and VueJS as well.

Overall, I think it is nearly impossible to have a solid grasp on web development and the Simple Charity website in only seven weeks. I hope that by the time you are reading this that Brian has hired an engineer who can help guide you in your work. Have fun, and set solid and achievable goals. Good luck! 

Sincerely, Mathew Luo
